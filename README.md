# GAN "using" (lol) this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004

# TODO
- Add skip connections or residual blocks to network
- ZIP:
  - Trained network
  - Code (I'm assuming)
  - Video of 2 min showing a demo running the code;
  - README:
    - how to run the code using the trained network;
    - how to train the networks
    - and what you did exactly explain in English or French.


# Tutorial

This lab (Pratical Work/tutorial/TP) is for Master student of the course "Machine Learning and Images".

From a video of a source person and another of a person, the objective is to generate a new video of the targeted person performing the same movements as the source. We test several NN than learn how to generate images of the targeted person according to a skeleton pose.
